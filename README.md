# TipCalculator

Quick and simple iOS app that is optimized for iPhone 6. Has a simple splash/launch screen that fades into the app. 

Added functionality:
- The billAmount clears when you click on it.
- The billAmount formats when you click off.
- Added some styling to enhance the look and feel of the app.

Overall, the app was kept simple to maintain a familiar UX.

Total hours to create this app was around 2.5/3 hours.

Currently working to add addition features like storing the billAmount when the app is left.
